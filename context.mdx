# `consumer-website`

The Gatsby repo uses `Context` in several places:

- `FeatureFlagsContext`
- `LocaleContext`
- `ThemeContext`
- `ScrollContext`
- `UtmParamContext`

---

Using these `Context` components incorrectly can lead to üêõüêû.

So, let's review how they work!

--- 

# What does Context look like?

---

# Context

`Context` = `Provider(s)` + `Consumers`

1. Create a new `Context`
2. Create a value and the logic that updates it
3. Pass the value to a `Provider`
4. Consume the value with `Consumers`

---

# Why use Context?

---

# Global state

Context let's you send values to components down the tree without passing them as props through every level.

Whenever the `Provider` receives a new value, it transmits it to each `Consumer`, which re-renders. üì°

This can be help synchronize values across the component tree, like theme styles, localization, etc.

---

# How to use Context?

---

# Create Context

1. Create a new `Context` instance
2. Optionally, give it a default value (only used if no `Provider`)

```jsx
import { createContext } from 'react'

const NewContext = createContext(defaultValue);
```

---

# Add a Provider

1. Generally, add _one_ `Provider` component as high up the component tree as necessary to wrap all `Consumers`.
2. Add nested `Provider` instances if you need to override the main instance in a specific part of the tree (rare).
3. The `Provider` is always implemented as a `JSX` wrapper:

```jsx
import NewContext from './NewContext'

<NewContext.Provider value={/* some value */}>
  {/* children */}
</NewContext.Provider>
```

---

# Add Consumers

1. Use _multiple_ `Consumers`
2. Place each `Consumer` as close to the component that uses it as possible (ideally, _inside_ that component)
3. A `Consumer` receives its value from the nearest `Provider`
4. A `Consumer` can be implemented as a `JSX` wrapper (using the render prop pattern) or with a hook:

---

# Add Consumers

```jsx
import NewContext from './NewContext'

<NewContext.Consumer>
  {value => /* JSX using value */}
</NewContext.Consumer>
```

```jsx
import { useContext } from 'react'
import NewContext from './NewContext'

function MyComponent() {
  const value = useContext(NewContext);

  return /* JSX using value */
}
```

---

# What can go wrong?

---

## Unintentional Re-renders üîÅ

When a `Consumer` re-renders, it re-renders any extra components that are wrapped by `<Consumer />` or inside the component calling `useContext()` as well.

These unintentional re-renders reset each component to its initial state, which can break the UI. üò±

---

# Scrolling bug üêõ

The scrolling bug on the two live pages was happening because the entire page was unintentionally re-rendering every time the user scrolled.

These unintentional re-renders reset all images to their blurred state, reset all accordions to showing their first pane, etc.

TODO: link to old deploy with the issue?

```jsx
// ...
return (
  <ScrollProvider>
    <ScrollContext.Consumer>
      {({ navClass }) => (
        <NavComponent navClass={navClass} />
        <ComponentThatShouldNotReRender1 />
        <ComponentThatShouldNotReRender2 />
        // ...
        <ComponentThatShouldNotReRender10 />
      )}
    </ScrollContext.Consumer>
  </ScrollProvider>
)
```

---

# Solution

1. Move the `Provider` up the tree into `AppProvider`
2. Move the `Consumer` down the tree into `NavComponent`

---

# TL;DR

1. Pair one `Provider` with multiple `Consumers`
2. Add the `Provider` high enough to wrap all `Consumers`
3. Isolate the `JSX` that should re-render and place each `Consumer` as close to it as possible
